# C# .NET Framework WinForms Project
## Initial video game code written from scratch using the system's graphics class.

#### Description of work
- Writing this code has not only allowed me to practice and gain more experience in C# and the .NET Framework, but
  also demonstrates my ability to write good clean code that can accomplish something cool.
- The project initially began with simply practicing C# and the .NET Framework with the Microsoft Visual Studio Windows Form project, but then
  grew into removing a lot of the template code and turning the windows form into the beginning of a game.
- Back in highschool this was something I really wanted to do but couldn't figure out how using this very framework.
  I eventually started using the XNA framework instead, then Monogame, then Unity.  This time I was easily able
  to accomplish what I did here, demonstrating to myself how far a long I have come since then.

#### One of the features of this code that I am proud of is how easy it is to add an obstacle to the game.
- All it takes is adding two statements.
  - One to the Content class to add the Sprite to the Sprite dictionary, then
  - One to the GameObject class to add an Entity object using the new Sprite.
